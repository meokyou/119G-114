            <p>
              This book is about a person back in the 70s that had to suffer through racism and to entertain all these white men who were manipulating his life, like a marionette gets controlled by a puppet-master. This poor boy that grows up to become a man in a much shorter time than most people, this makes him as a result much tougher than most people causing him to do whatever is necessary to achieve the goal of a civil rights movement to continue the dream for equity. Vivid scenes of violence permeate the book's composition contributing to the idea, that feeling of sickening discomfort, of confusioned, frienzed progression, such as the narrator's own unfair, unforgiving biographic. The many unsavoury encounters that the narrator is drowned in during his bildungsroman allows us the reader to better comprehend his adversity to depart his well-lit, yet drab, escapism-rendered, underground abode. We are introduced to this in the prolouge, which only creates intrigue over his eventual exodus, perhaps—only parially—representing his trauma-inspired languid conclusion which we are privy to only within the final pages. The narrator decided—basically—that he no longer has to take on the idealogy or persona of others, because the humanity within himself cannot be so easily defined...leaving him with, to best serve his community he has to be only him, complex in nature, self. Throughout the book the narrartor is mistaken to be a great many different people, and although he himself is never named the personas he assumes are commentaries on different things such as separatism. It is the main charcter search for some personal truth that is the actual journy taking place. While Ellison draws the reader in with brilliant scenes of satirical

            <h3>National Museum of Civil Rights</h3>
            <span>The National Civil Rights Museum is a complex of museums and historic buildings in Memphis, Tennessee; its exhibits trace the history of the civil rights movement in the United States from the 17th century to the present.
            </span>
            <h3>Connection to <i>Invisible Man</i></h3>
            <p>The museum is a chronicle of African American history and is a representation of the abuses wrongfully subjected onto them. It shows some of the real life parallels of the racially motivated events in Invisible Man. It provides context to the settings of 1970, America and allows us to better navigate the social landscape the narrator is challenged with. The subject-matter of the hotel is quite broad and provides large quantites of information to the general condition of Black people. The events in the museum lead up to the books time-setting.</p>

            <h3>Afterimages</h3>
            <h3>Audre Geraldine Lorde</h3>
            <p>Emmett Louis Till was a fourteen-year-old African American child who was lynched in 1955, Mississippi, after being accussed of offending, or whistling at a white woman, Mrs. Bryant. Roy Bryant, husband of the mistress, counselled by his half-brother, John William Milam, assisted by J.W. Washington, a Black man, unwillfully, not before kidnapping another teenager from the road, using his pickup truck as tool of choice, early in the morning, two to three-thirty ante meridiem, abducted Emmet Till from the home of a preacher, Mose Wright, armed, by way of Washington. Threatening the old man, then at age 64, Mister Wright did not resist his abduction. Despite those closest to him looking for him rigorously they—sadly—could nor would find him alive again. Three days after his, gruesome, unjustified, murder by way of Bryant's entourage of hirees, Till's swollen and disgigured corpse was found by two boys who were fishin in the Tallahctchie River. </p>
            <p>This poem was chosen because the metaphor utilised by Lorde resembles the overarching 'invisiblity' present Ellison's work, although the diction used to respectievely arrive at the message and hidden truth differ. An Elegy of Till's death, the poem envokes strong emotional feelings via allegory and synedoche metaphor based elements to convey the meaning of a given section. Overall, the diction of Lorde exudes the same depressing feeling as Emerson's writing albeit in a different approach. On one hand it feels like, as exemplfied in the novel, the calm and almost satirical buildup differs from the more direct approach of Lorde.</p>
