            <p>
              This book is about a person back in the 70s that had to suffer through racism and to entertain all these white men who were manipulating his life like a marionette gets controlled by a puppet-master. This poor boy that grows up to become a man in a much shorter time than most people has it harder than most people, this makes him as a result much tougher than most people causing him to do whatever is necessary to achieve the goal of a civil rights movement to continue the dream for equity. Vivid scenes of violence permeate the book's composition contributing to the idea, that feeling of sickening discomfort, of confusioned, frienzed progression, such as the narrator's own unfair, unforgiving biographic. The many unsavoury encounters that the narrator is drowned in during his <i>bildungsroman</i> allows us the reader to better comprehend his adversity to depart his well-lit, yet drab, escapism-rendered, underground abode. We are introduced to this in the prolouge, which only creates intrigue over his eventual exodus, perhaps—only parially—representing his truma-inspired languid conclusion which we are privy to only within the final pages. Of course, the state the world he hid from, , is macabre as riots assault the streets of Harlem.

            <h4>Audre Geraldine Lorde</h4>
            <p>Emmett Louis Till was a fourteen-year-old African American child who was lynched in 1955, Mississippi, after being accussed of offending, or whistling at a white woman, Mrs. Bryant. Roy Bryant, husband of the mistress, counselled by his half-brother, John William Milam, assisted by J.W. Washington, a Black man, unwillfully, not before kidnapping another teenager from the road, using his pickup truck as tool of choice, early in the morning, two to three-thirty ante meridiem, abducted Emmet Till from the home of a preacher, Mose Wright, armed, by way of Washington. Threatening the old man, then at age 64, Mister Wright did not resist his abduction. Despite those closest to him looking for him rigorously they—sadly—could nor would find him alive again. Three days after his, gruesome, unjustified, murder by way of Bryant's entourage of hirees, Till's swollen and disgigured corpse was found by two boys who were fishin in the Tallahctchie River. </p>
